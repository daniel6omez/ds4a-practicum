# Baseline Model Report

_Baseline model is the the model a data scientist would train and evaluate quickly after he/she has the first (preliminary) feature set ready for the machine learning modeling. Through building the baseline model, the data scientist can have a quick assessment of the feasibility of the machine learning task._

## Analytic Approach

- What is target definition
- What are inputs (description)
- What kind of model was built?

## Model Description

- Models and Parameters

  - Description or images of data flow graph

    - Link to:

      - Training experiment
      - Scoring workflow

  - What learner(s) were used?
  - Learner hyper-parameters

## Results (Model Performance)

- ROC/Lift charts, AUC, R^2, MAPE as appropriate
- Performance graphs for parameters sweeps if applicable

## Model Understanding

- Variable Importance (significance)

- Insight Derived from the Model

## Conclusion and Discussions for Next Steps

- Conclusion on Feasibility Assessment of the Machine Learning Task

- Discussion on Overfitting (If Applicable)

- What other Features Can Be Generated from the Current Data

- What other Relevant Data Sources Are Available to Help the Modeling
